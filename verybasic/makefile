# This is a prototype Makefile. Modify it according to your needs.
# You should at least check the settings for
# DEVICE ....... The AVR device you compile for
# CLOCK ........ Target AVR clock rate in Hertz
# OBJECTS ...... The object files created from your source files. This list is
#                usually the same as the list of source files with suffix ".o".
# PROGRAMMER ... Options to avrdude which define the hardware you use for
#                uploading to the AVR and the interface where this hardware
#                is connected. We recommend that you leave it undefined and
#                add settings like this to your ~/.avrduderc file:
#                   default_programmer = "stk500v2"
#                   default_serial = "avrdoper"
# FUSES ........ Parameters for avrdude to flash the fuses appropriately.

DEVICE     = attiny2313
CLOCK      = 12000000
PROGRAMMER = -c usbtiny -p attiny2313
OBJECTS    = main.o
FUSES      = -U lfuse:w:0xcf:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m
INC        = -I ./usbdrv/

# For computing fuse byte values for other devices and options see
# the fuse bit calculator at http://www.engbedded.com/fusecalc/


# Tune the lines below only if you know what you are doing:

AVRDUDE = avrdude $(PROGRAMMER) -p $(DEVICE)

# symbolic targets:
all:	main.hex

flash:	all
	$(AVRDUDE) -U flash:w:main.hex:i

fuse:
	$(AVRDUDE) $(FUSES)

# Xcode uses the Makefile targets "", "clean" and "install"
install: flash fuse

clean:
	rm -f main.hex main.elf $(OBJECTS)

# If you have an EEPROM section, you must also create a hex file for the
# EEPROM and add it to the "flash" target.

# Targets for code debugging and analysis:
disasm:	main.elf
	avr-objdump -d main.elf

cpp:
	$(COMPILE) -E main.c

.c.o:
	$(COMPILE) -c $< -o $@

.S.o:
	$(COMPILE) -x assembler-with-cpp -c usbdrv/usbdrvasm.S -o usbdrv/usbdrvasm.o -c $< -o $@
# "-x assembler-with-cpp" should not be necessary since this is the default
# file type for the .S (with capital S) extension. However, upper case
# characters are not always preserved on Windows. To ensure WinAVR
# compatibility define the file type manually.

.c.s:
	$(COMPILE) -S $< -o $@
